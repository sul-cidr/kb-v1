            "<p>What could unite the five disparate individuals – Stamford Raffles, Napoleon, Caroline Capel, Jane Austen and John Quincy Adams – whose records you see floating in the visualization panel opposite? The answer is the effects of an explosion on the far side of the world.</p><p>It was titanic, sudden and indiscriminately destructive, an apocalypse of natural rage. It was, literally, like nothing anyone had ever witnessed before. <a class='focusAction' onclick='zoomByPreset(1,[-400,0]);workingArbitraryPlaceArray.push({size: 3,rounding: 5,coords: [-8.246, 117.958],label: \"Tambora\",pulsing: true,color: \"red\"});placeArbitraryPlace(workingArbitraryPlaceArray);divLayout.network=\"none\";divLayout.map=\"full\";divLayout.timeline=\"none\";resizePanes();'>Mount Tambora on the Indonesian island of Sumbava erupted</a> with fluctuating levels of intensity (from huge to unprecedented) for ten days in April 1815, the last year of the Napoleonic Wars. Dwarfing the scale of destruction caused by human conflict, it was the most violent explosion in recorded history, creating an eruption column 18 miles high as the volcano pumped around 100 cubic kilometers of molten rock into the air, along with millions of tons of gases (including hydrogen chloride and sulphur dioxide), ash and dust.</p><p>The Tambora eruption was so cataclysmic that it reduced the mountain&rsquo;s own height by around a third. There were whirlwinds, ash clouds, tsunami and forest fires that covered hundreds of miles. Tribal chiefs decided it was a pitched battle between the devil and the souls of their dead ancestors. In Indonesia alone, around 90,000 people died from the short-term and longer-term effects of the catastrophe. But the devastation&rsquo;s impact was global rather than solely local. A massive aerosol cloud of dust and sulphur particles from Tambora slowly settled in the earth&rsquo;s stratosphere enveloping the entire planet and affecting the weather and temperature on every continent, but especially those in the northern hemisphere. The cloud indirectly led to riots, disease, famine, forced migrations and tens of thousands more deaths on the other side of the globe from the volcano.</p><p>1816, the year after the Tambora eruption, is known as the “Year Without a Summer” because of the climate abnormalities and attendant crop failures caused by Tambora&rsquo;s dust cloud combined with a period of exceptionally low solar activity (the “Dalton Minimum”). Throughout 1816 Italy experienced falls of red snow. And for years there were sublimely gleaming yellow sunsets across European skies, like natural versions of the dramatic pictures the artist J. M. W. Turner would subsequently paint.</p><p>In the Bible it says that God “maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust”. Like everyone else, the people alive in the Kindred Britain familial network in 1816, wherever they were in the world, experienced the strange, dampened feeling of the Year Without a Summer. Like everyone, they had to exist in relation to the moods of Gaia, the “great mother of all”. Kindred Britain focuses primarily on familial relationships, but the site also allows you to connect people by many other criteria including professions, tragedy values, lifespans, centrality measures and, as here, spatial synchrony. The effect is similar to the sensation of unconnected connectedness that James Joyce produced in the “Wandering Rocks” episode in his novel <span class='emphasize'>Ulysses</span> where disparate citizens of Dublin wander simultaneously on multiple paths through the streets of Ireland&rsquo;s capital city. Here are the connected unconnections in 1816 of some of the individuals present in Kindred Britain, unified by their experience of Mount Tambora&rsquo;s aftermath.</p><p>In 1816, <a class='focusAction' onclick='divLayout.network=\"full\";divLayout.map=\"none\";divLayout.timeline=\"none\";resizePanes();setTimeout(\"showThirdBio(&#39;I25056&#39;)\", focusClickDelay)' onmouseout='anyOut()' onmouseover='anyOver({id: \"I25056\"},0,\"vignettecontent\")'>Stamford Raffles</a>, former Lieutenant Governor of Java, part of the Dutch East Indies colony that included Sumbava, had been recalled to England. On 25 March 1816, Raffles sailed for England from Batavia (Jakarta). At the start of the voyage, his ship had to negotiate the floating debris of Tambora: “Immense pumice rafts, some as large as three miles across, [littering] the Java Sea, moving steadily to the west”. After rounding the Cape, Raffles sailed north, stopping off on the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic to seek an audience with the defeated and exiled <a class='focusAction' onclick='divLayout.network=\"full\";divLayout.map=\"none\";divLayout.timeline=\"none\";resizePanes();setTimeout(\"showThirdBio(&#39;I28778&#39;)\", focusClickDelay)' onmouseout='anyOut()' onmouseover='anyOver({id: \"I28778\"},0,\"vignettecontent\")'>Napoleon</a> on 19 May 1816.

He rested briefly in Cornwall after the long sea-voyage from Java before setting off for London. The effects of the eruption that he had heard occurring in April 1815 had followed him round the world.

Byron and Polidori were ensconced at the Villa Diodati, the home Byron was renting at Coligny near Geneva. Shelley and Mary were staying at the Villa Montalègre. Byron had been forced to leave England after, amongst other disreputable things, having an affair with Clairmont and during the dark summer of 1816 Clairmont realized she was pregnant: their daughter <a class='focusAction' onclick='divLayout.network=\"full\";divLayout.map=\"none\";divLayout.timeline=\"none\";resizePanes();setTimeout(\"showThirdBio(&#39;I4856&#39;)\", focusClickDelay)' onmouseout='anyOut()' onmouseover='anyOver({id: \"I4856\"},0,\"vignettecontent\")'>Allegra</a> would be born in January of the following year. Another writer sporadically present at Villa Diodati was the Gothic novelist “Monk” Lewis. The weather soon became too wet to allow the English-speaking party to spend much time outdoors.</p><p>On a rainy night in June 1816 Byron read aloud to the group from <span class='emphasize'>Fantasmagoriana</span>, a French translation of a selection of German horror stories. He also proposed a competition in which they would each write a ghost story. Out of this challenge came Mary Shelley&rsquo;s <span class='emphasize'>Frankenstein</span> (1818) and Polidori&rsquo;s <span class='emphasize'>The Vampyre</span> (1819): it was as if Villa Diodati were the equivalent of a small volcanic cone from which formative examples of literary horror suddenly spewed forth.</p><p>In the aftermath of Byron&rsquo;s suggestion, the young Mary Shelley could think of nothing to write about. But, as the rain continued day after day, the saturnine assembly lingered indoors and talked. In this damp enclave a spark came. Mary Shelley remembered:</p><p class='indented'>Many and long were the conversations between Lord Byron and Shelley, to which I was a devout but nearly silent listener. During one of these, various philosophical doctrines were discussed, and among others the nature of the principle of life, and whether there was any probability of its ever being discovered and communicated. They talked of the experiments of Dr. Darwin, (I speak not of what the Doctor really did, or said that he did, but, as more to my purpose, of what was then spoken of as having been done by him,) who preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case, till by some extraordinary means it began to move with voluntary motion.</p><p>When she retired and “placed my head on my pillow, I did not sleep, nor could I be said to think. My imagination, unbidden, possessed and guided me, gifting the successive images that arose in my mind with a vividness far beyond the usual bounds of reverie.” Perhaps the prompting was the fertilizing idea of <a class='focusAction' onclick='divLayout.network=\"full\";divLayout.map=\"none\";divLayout.timeline=\"none\";resizePanes();setTimeout(\"showThirdBio(&#39;I5906&#39;)\", focusClickDelay)' onmouseout='anyOut()' onmouseover='anyOver({id: \"I5906\"},0,\"vignettecontent\")'>Erasmus Darwin</a>, a doctor who wrote about “unallowe&rsquo;d desires” and “illicit loves”. Perhaps it was the thought of the glass case with the vermicelli (in Italian, the “little worm”) inside, suddenly moving “with voluntary motion”.</p><p>Or perhaps there was simply something frighteningly inspirational about being the teenage lover of a poet who had eloped with her to Europe, and about already, at the age of eighteen, being the mother of two illegitimate children (one of whom, a daughter, was already dead), as well as about being herself illegitimate. Or, again, was it something about being in Switzerland with her teenage half-sister (also the child of an illegitimate liaison that her mother had had with another man than her own father) who was now pregnant with a child fathered by the notorious English lord who was their host at Villa Diodati? Or perhaps it was simply a stimulus caused in Mary Shelley&rsquo;s mind by the mood of a world eerily darkened and drenched in mid-summer by the effects of a vast natural eruption. Mary Shelley&rsquo;s world was inspiringly full of unsanctioned connections and troubling possibilities.</p><p>Shelley later argued that: “Invention, it must be humbly admitted, does not consist in creating out of void, but out of chaos”. Something could not come from nothing. Very often, critics have traced the origins of <span class='emphasize'>Frankenstein</span> to philosophical debates about “life” in the abstract sense. But when Shelley discusses the novel her language consistently circles around the idea of “life” in a more direct, personal and materialistic tenor. The emphasis on “creation” – and the giving of “form to dark, shapeless substances” – never seems very far from an emphasis on human procreation.</p><p>What Shelley said about her novel mirrors closely what the book&rsquo;s central character, Victor Frankenstein, feels about his monstrous, infamous invention. Frankenstein galvanizes his creature with a “spark of being”, probably a lightning bolt (like a mirror version of the upward jet of fire that shot out of Tambora&rsquo;s fiery crater). As he says after he has completed his experiment and is contemplating the results of what he wryly calls “my creation”:</p><p class='indented'>I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had deprived myself of rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart.</p><p>With encouragement from her poet lover, Mary Shelley began the writing of the book in earnest in around October 1816 and completed the main draft in May 1817, a gestation of about eight months. In December 1816, after the book had been started but while it was still taking shape, in the midst of the process of composition, Shelley the poet married Shelley the novelist-to-be. <span class='emphasize'>Frankenstein</span> was published on the first day of 1818.</p>",
            "<p>Family, Kindred Britain&rsquo;s core concern, is central to <span class='emphasize'>Frankenstein</span>. In 1831, Mary Shelley explained that before she wrote <span class='emphasize'>Frankenstein</span> she had wanted to produce books but had been unable to do so, being preoccupied with: “Travelling, and the cares of a family, … and study, in the way of reading, or improving my ideas.” Her apparent meaning is that the duties involved with looking after her infant children and her lover had stood in her way. But when she began <span class='emphasize'>Frankenstein</span> the book she wrote transposed the phrase about “the cares of a family” into a different sense. <span class='emphasize'>Frankenstein</span> is not about caring for a family; it is a book about a family&rsquo;s sorrows. In Victor Frankenstein&rsquo;s portion of the narrative, the most important word in his very first sentence is “family”. And, throughout his narrative, many of the story&rsquo;s turning points involve the fates of family members.</p><p>For example, the death of Frankenstein&rsquo;s mother shortly before her son departs for university is the apparent stimulus to his compensatory desire to infuse “life into an inanimate body.” A death produces the desire to make a life. The monster, to whom Victor Frankenstein denies a mate that would allow him to propagate a whole race of monsters, later seems to take particular delight in revenging himself on Frankenstein family members: the brother William and the scientist&rsquo;s bride Elizabeth. The death from grief of Frankenstein&rsquo;s father is symbolically associated with these other deaths: at one remove, he is another of the monster&rsquo;s victims. <span class='emphasize'>Frankenstein</span>&rsquo;s narrative logic relies profoundly for its shape and its momentum on “the cares of a family”.</p><p>Noticing the important of the familial themes in Mary Shelley&rsquo;s novel makes reflection on Shelley&rsquo;s own family impossible to avoid. The emotional and social complexities are astonishing. Mary&rsquo;s father, the radical philosopher and novelist William Godwin, never married Mary&rsquo;s mother, the author Mary Wollstonecraft. However Godwin later married Mary Jane Clairmont, who had already had two illegitimate children by different men. (At the time of the marriage, she called herself a widow but this was probably no more than a polite, socially acceptable fiction.) Godwin and Clairmont had a son of their own, William, a journalist, who died of cholera in 1832. Claire Clairmont, Mary Jane Clairmont&rsquo;s daughter and Mary Shelley&rsquo;s half-sister, had an affair with Byron, as we have already seen, and gave birth to their short-lived daughter Allegra. (The girl was briefly adopted by the doomed Shelleys.) By contrast, Claire Clairmont herself proved to be one of the longest-lasting members of the generally short-lived Byron-Shelley circle, dying in Florence in 1879 at the age of 80.</p><p>Mary Shelley&rsquo;s mother, Mary Wollstonecraft, was also, like Mary Jane Clairmont, the mother of two illegitimate daughters: Mary Shelley (with Godwin) and Frances Imlay (with the author and speculator Gilbert Imlay). Wollstonecraft, whose most famous book was <span class='emphasize'>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</span>, fell prey to the not uncommon fate of mothers in the per-antibiotic era, dying just a few days after Mary Shelley was born. Mary Shelley eloped with the poet P. B. Shelley was she was just 16 years old. She had and lost her first child, a daughter, Clara, when she was just 17. By the time <span class='emphasize'>Frankenstein</span> was published in 1818 she was the mother of two more children, a son, William, and a second Clara. The latter died later that same year at the age of 1 and the former lasted only until he was three years old, dying of malaria in Rome in 1819. A few months after William&rsquo;s death, Mary Shelley had her final child, Percy Florence Shelley. Percy was two when his father drowned in the Gulf of Spezia in July 1822.</p><p>So, by the time she was 24 years old, Mary Shelley had written <span class='emphasize'>Frankenstein</span>, had given birth to four children and had lost three of them as well as losing her husband. <span class='emphasize'>Frankenstein</span> is filled with lurid, violent deaths exacted or caused by an unreal monster. In comparison, the <a class='focusAction' onclick='divLayout.network=\"full\";divLayout.map=\"none\";divLayout.timeline=\"none\";resizePanes();setTimeout(\"plotNetwork(&#39;birthyear&#39;,&#39;end&#39;);colorByAttribute(&#39;tragedy&#39;,[&#39;#CCFF99&#39;,&#39;#5CAD5C&#39;,&#39;#336600&#39;])\",500);'>fragility of the multiple actual existences around Mary Shelley seems somehow more tragic, more mundane and more frightening</a>. The plot to the right shows how Mary Shelley&rsquo;s family history began to dip towards the tragic with the death of her mother, Mary Wollstonecraft in 1797 at the age of 28. Shelley&rsquo;s first three children all died in infancy. And her husband perished at the age of 29. Thinking about <span class='emphasize'>Frankenstein</span> in a metaphoric register makes one aware that the novel&rsquo;s themes about creation and about the agony and destruction that this creation trails through the world in its wake resonate strongly with Shelley&rsquo;s own actual circumstances. If one adds the suicide of her half-sister Fanny Imlay in Swansea in October 1816 at the age of 22 (just as Mary Shelley was starting to draft the final version of <span class='emphasize'>Frankenstein</span>), then the impression of darkness and sadness in Mary Shelley&rsquo;s world is deepened. So too is the impression that death strikes disproportionately early in the Romantic world around Shelley and Byron at women: mothers, sisters and daughters (and the adopted daughter Allegra Byron). Mary Shelley died in Victorian London, probably of a brain tumour, in 1851. She was 53.</p>",
            "<p>In many respects, looking at the family tree for her husband, the poet <a class='focusAction' onclick='setTimeout(\"showThirdBio(&#39;I4499&#39;)\", focusClickDelay)' onmouseout='anyOut()' onmouseover='anyOver({id: \"I4499\"},0,\"vignettecontent\")'>P.

She died not long after Fanny Imlay had committed suicide in Wales, and her death freed her husband to marry Mary Shelley a mere 20 days later. P. B. Shelley had two children with Harriet Westbrook, Eliza (who died in 1876) and Charles who died as an 11 year-old in 1822. Death seems to stalk these social outcasts.</p>",
            "<p>The pervasiveness of early death amongst the second generation of Romantic poets is a 100 year-old commonplace: Keats died in 1821 aged 25; Shelley died in 1822 aged 29; Byron died in 1824 aged 36. But when you reflect on the families that Shelley and Byron lived in the midst of, and on the milieu out of which a text such as <span class='emphasize'>Frankenstein</span> arose, then the story is more mixed and nuanced. The poets died young but so did many who lived with them: Clara Shelley (1815), Fanny Imlay (1816), Harriet Westbrook (1816), the second Clara Shelley (1818), William Shelley (1819), Allegra Byron (1822) and Charles Shelley (1826). Gilbert Imlay, the father of Fanny Imlay, died in 1828. In his elegy for Keats, “Adonaïs”, written in the early summer of 1821, Shelley wrote that it is not the dead who are to be pitied, but those who love on after them and who:</p><p class='indented'>decay</p><p class='indented'>Like corpses in a charnel; fear and grief</p><p class='indented'>Convulse us and consume us day by day,</p><p class='indented'>And cold hopes swarm like worms within our living clay.</p><p>But was life an affair of “cold hopes swarm[ing] like worms within our living clay” for everybody? Neither William Godwin&rsquo;s or Mary Wollstonecraft&rsquo;s parents died especially young. Nor did Percy and Mary Shelley&rsquo;s parents, Sir Timothy and Lady Shelley, both of whom died in the 1840s at the ages of 90 and 83 respectively. And their grandson, Sir Percy Shelley, the offspring of shortlived Shelley the poet and Shelley the novelist, and the man who succeeded to the Shelley baronetcy, died at the age of 70 in 1889. So not all branches of the Godwin-Shelley family tree were cursed by repeated occurrences of early death. Rather, it seems that it was the maritally unconventional, the rebellious and the creative (as well as, unfortunately, their children) who tended to pass away abnormally quickly as if they were an extension of the same catalogue of deaths that fills the pages of <span class='emphasize'>Frankenstein</span>. The socially unadventurous and privileged (the Shelleys were a prominent Sussex gentry family: in 1857 P. B. Shelley&rsquo;s niece Elizabeth married Sir Frederick Peel, son of the tory Prime Minister Robert Peel) tended to live longer and more securely and more circumspectly. They became, both literally and symbolically, Victorians.</p><p>They also tended to die in Britain, unlike P. B. Shelley, Byron or Keats. Kindred Britain allows you to explore a sample of the rich or rootless, eminent or dissatisfied figures from Britain who died in Italy or Greece during the 19th century. <a class='focusAction' onclick='toggleDisplay(\"searchShare\");'>There are 86 such people shown in the visualization opposite</a>, <a class='focusAction' onclick='divLayout.network=\"full\";divLayout.map=\"none\";divLayout.timeline=\"none\";resizePanes();setTimeout(\"plotNetwork(&#39;birthyear&#39;,&#39;end&#39;);colorByAttribute(&#39;odnb&#39;,[&#39;#CCFF99&#39;,&#39;#5CAD5C&#39;,&#39;#336600&#39;])\",500);'>34 of whom are considered eminent enough to have, as an accompaniment to their resting place in foreign soil, their own entry in the <span class='emphasize'>ODNB</span></a>.

It is a fascinating and highly various catalogue of exilic British prominence.</p><p>Finally in this story about the personal realities behind the fictive, a personal note by the author. <span class='emphasize'>Frankenstein</span> is a novel about a creation that escapes from the intentions and control of its creator (and which ultimately kills him). Mary Shelley&rsquo;s book was perhaps itself a sort of monster that took on a life a bit like that of its own subject. In her entry on Mary Shelley in the <span class='emphasize'>ODNB</span>, Betty T. Bennett writes that the “story of the scientist and his creature rapidly permeated all levels of society, and became the material of theatrical productions, newspapers, political cartoons, parliamentary debate, translations, and countless inexpensive and/or pirated reprints.” <span class='emphasize'>Frankenstein</span> swarmed everywhere in Victorian culture, its original meanings distorted or emended, its intended purposes ignored as it became a myth that could mean a hundred different things. Whatever Mary Shelley had wanted her book to be, it rapidly took on an unplanned and perhaps slightly monstrous life of its own.</p><p>If this novel is about the horror of creation, or, to put it only slightly more extensively, about the terror of slowly understanding that you have brought into being something that then exceeds your power to control it or even to understand it, then the book <span class='emphasize'>Frankenstein</span> also became a sort of “fiend” in its own right. On a far more modest scale, that is a bit like what I feel has happened with my own “wretch”, Kindred Britain.</p><p>Looking back to 1816, the “Year Without a Summer”, from a world in which global climate changes are not the product of a singular event such as the vast eruption of Mount Tambora but the result of a steady, ongoing accumulation of predictable and measurable causes, I contemplate Mary Shelley&rsquo;s family history with fascination and fellow-feeling. And then I think about the vast numbers of stories, many of which I will never explore, that this site, Kindred Britain, is capable of generating for users. I think about the many questions that can never occur to me but which the site could answer, were I clever enough to ask it. I reflect on the ways that Kindred Britain&rsquo;s functionality – the plotting, sorting, graphing and path-finding – sometimes exceeds my own ability to understand what such powerful programming could actually achieve as an example of new ways to undertake humanistic inquiry. This is the predicament, or the sensation, of a humanist scholar standing at the frontier where an entirely foreign set of languages and disciplines begin: mathematics, computer science, visualization theory, statistics. Like me, many scholars find themselves at such a place these days. Perhaps, like me, some of them are also not quite sure what they have done, nor what the full implications of their work are. As “the rain pattered dismally against the panes,” Victor Frankenstein watched a terrifying scene: “by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.” I imagine that, like me (and unlike Frankenstein), few scholars indeed are only sorry to be part of a generation creating such new scholarly hybrids, freaks or monsters.</p><p>[Note: some of the quotations in this story are drawn from: W.

            "<p class='emphasize'>John Berger, that most wonderful writer, once wrote: “Never again will a single story be told as though it&rsquo;s the only one.” There can never be a single story. There are only ways of seeing. So when I tell a story, I tell it not as an ideologue who wants to pit one absolutist ideology against another, but as a story-teller who wants to share her way of seeing.</p><p>- Arundhati Roy</p><p>Because you can not read, in the traditional manner, such a large corpus as Kindred Britain, we need to employ methods to transform unstructured data (or less structured data) into structured data amenable for analysis and representation. Along with using network analysis methods to compute the centrality of individuals within this network, we&rsquo;ve also tried to <a class='focusAction' onclick='colorByAttribute(&#39;tragedy&#39;,[&#39;#CCFF99&#39;,&#39;#5CAD5C&#39;,&#39;#336600&#39;])' >summarize the level of tragedy in their lives</a> using a computational approach.</p><p>In the case of our Tragedy Index, we assign points for tragic events that can be gleaned from the events and attributes of individuals and their families. The use of points and scores implies a game perspective on the life of individuals and allows us to see the most tragic--or highest scoring in tragedy--individuals in Kindred Britain, as shown here. This took a dialectic approach, with the first tragedy index based solely on the lifespan of the individual and their parents and children. The individual scored a point if:</p><ul><li>One died before the age of 45.</li><li>One&rsquo;s parents died before one was the age of 13.</li><li>One&rsquo;s children died before the child was the age of 13.</li></ul><p>Along with these initial measures, we attempted to identify other “tragic” events that might be visible to a computational lens. We went on to try to determine if someone died of violence by reading descriptions of his or her death and searching for the following keywords: “battle”, “wounds”, “killed in action”, “hanged”, “shot”, “executed”, “beheaded”, “tower hill”, “Tyburn”, “murdered”, “stabbed”, “suicide”, “killed himself”, “killed herself” or “cwgc.org” in the description of their death event. If this was the case, then that individual would get a point for “dying young or of violence” regardless of the age of their death. A point was also awarded for mental illness based on the presence of keywords “insane”, “breakdown”, or “lunatic” in any events associated with the individual. Finally, a point was awarded for the death of every sibling before that sibling reaches the age of 13.</p><p>Turning a critical gaze to this system of computing tragedy gives rise to the ever-present issue of sparseness in the database. If a family is not fully described in Kindred Britain then it can lead to an individual having a lower than actual tragedy score, just as an unknown death date that we had to extrapolate may end up too early and give the family members a point for a falsely young death. This is a problem with any approach to compressing humanistic data into numerical data, similar to the effects of gaps in corpora for literary analysis or optical character recognition errors in transforming texts into machine-readable form.</p>",
            "<p>But there&rsquo;s a second critical gaze that can be applied to such actions specifically in cases such as these. The standards for <a class='focusAction' onclick='colorByAttribute(&#39;tragedy&#39;,[&#39;#CCFF99&#39;,&#39;#5CAD5C&#39;,&#39;#336600&#39;])' >identifying tragic events</a> in Kindred Britain themselves can be disputed, regardless of the quality or quantity of data available for such analysis. The point-value of tragic events could likewise be criticized. The results of changing these standards and values would be a different map of tragedy in British culture, and while it would be natural to think of such scores as better or worse, it&rsquo;s more reasonable to think of these as different perspectives on tragedy. One view of tragedy may value the loss of life in battle as greater than the loss of life to disease, and such a view may highlight different tragic structures in British culture.</p><p>The kid who gets blown up on the Western Front, whose parents both died when he was 14, and who was unmarried but left behind a grieving fiance receives a tragedy score of 1 in this system. As a result, Erasmus Darwin, who had 15 children by 4 partners and lived to the age of 71, had a life that was “four times” as tragic as Jack Kipling, who “only” died in battle at Soos at the age of 18.</p><p>You could use a different term than tragedy, arguing that it&rsquo;s a loaded word. But I think this simply dodges the issue, which is that when we take a computational gaze to such corpora, we reduce what are extremely messy, humanistic concepts into much cleaner numerical or categorical variables. But creating these primitive quantitative representations of cultural and social values allows us to see more clearly the correlation between tragedy (no matter how roughly defined) and other traits, such as notability, network centrality, or date of birth. Utilizing these means, scholars can examine vast corpora and biographies to identify new patterns in history and culture.</p><p>There is no best way to summarize tragedy among individuals in British history, and any change to the way the algorithm determines tragedy would provide new problematic cases. Still, works such as Kindred Britain provide more access and visibility to the decisions made in transforming the underlying data for representation and analysis. And in doing so, it should remind the user that the tragedies and loves of one&rsquo;s own life are likely being computationally defined to a greater and greater degree by the databases that we are part of.</p>"

        overview: "Here's a story about centrality and how we measured it and some interesting things thereof.",
        image: 'cent.png',
        content: [
            "<p>Kindred Britain is, at its core, a database of nearly 30,000 individuals, each person connected to every other through some kind of genealogical tie. This allows the database to be represented as a network, similar to the social networks used in social network analysis.</p><p>A network, in its most basic sense, is a group of things that we know are connected to each other and is, from a more general perspective, a view on such a group that emphasizes the character and patterns of these connections more than the things being connected. Networks are used to represent the patterns of social connections, but also the patterns of transportation routes, and even the connections between neurons in the brain. In the case of Kindred Britain, it is a network of people connected to each other via marriage and kinship. Typically in humanities scholarship, we look at groups of people from a biographical or demographical perspective, which entails examining individual or aggregated traits. In contrast, a network view is less about biography and demography and more about the emergent, systemic qualities that arise from the connections between individuals.</p><p>From that perspective, these individuals can be rated according to their network centrality, which implies a certain level of influence or importance within the network. Networks, whether transportation networks or social networks, have been found to provide benefits  to members that are particularly well-connected, and this is often referred to as “centrality”. To try to provide the most broadly useful measure of centrality in Kindred Britain, the centrality rank for each individual is based off of the average rank according to several measures that are explained in more detail later on. There are other ways to measure networks and a host of terms and types of networks and their sub-networks that are beyond the scope of this piece. Each individual in Kindred Britain has such a centrality rank, determining whether they are one of the ten, hundred, thousand, or ten thousand most central individuals in the network. There are corresponding categories for the least central, as well as a final group of nearly 10,000 individuals that are neither particularly central or not central.</p><p>To the right, we can see the top 20 most central individuals in Kindred Britain according to this Overall Centrality value. It's interesting to note that this group is <a class='focusAction' onclick='setActive(\"nBPr\",\"netProfessionButton\");setActive(\"nBF\",\"netLayoutButton\");freeNodes();setTimeout(\"addHull()\", focusClickDelay)'>dominated by politicians</a>. None of them are born before the 17th century or after the 19th century. This fits well with the distribution of individuals in the network, which peaks during this period as seen in the chart above. These highly central individuals are not only closely related to the whole of Kindred Britain, but to each other, and on average are only 6 steps apart  (with each step defined as a connection from spouse to spouse or parent to child or sibling to sibling). Many are connected by just a single common relative and the most distant from each other is only 12 steps away. For comparison, the average distance of any individual to the rest of the network is over 17 steps.</p><p>But centrality does not simply denote the densest part of the densest part of the network, as looking at the individual measures that make up Overall Centrality will reveal. This contrasts from traditional concepts of a “center” when examining a geometric shape like a circle or a geographic shape like a state. One way to conceive of how differing values for centrality can be described is to think of a place you want to travel to, and contrast how long it may take to get there versus how expensive it would be to get there and how you could get there at different costs and different speeds depending on whether you rode a bike or took a flight or traveled by bus. Places and people can be considered more or less central depending on how you measure that centrality and how you evaluate the manner in which they are connected.</p>",
            "<p>The 20 least central actors in the Kindred Britain network have a distinctly different character. Only three have known professions, which would be expected for individuals on the fringe of the network. Of those three, two are rulers from the late 10th and early 11th century. The measures of centrality we use either favor the denser parts of the network or the high traffic areas, such as the spine of royalty that dominates the earliest centuries of British elites represented in Kindred Britain. This spine, for instance, acts as a thoroughfare when trying to establish genealogical connections between individuals, just as particularly well-connected families in the later network act as hubs. As a result, the least central people have to be on the fringe of the network, which precludes the sparse but high-traffic early network and the dense late network.</p><p>This is why there are <a class='focusAction' onclick='plotNetwork(\"birthyear\",\"end\");colorByAttribute(\"birthyear\",[\"#3366CC\",\"#FFFF99\",\"#993333\"]);'>two identifiable troughs</a> in the system when looking at least central individuals. One is from the <a class='focusAction' onclick='moveTimeline(1000,850,20);'>late 9th to early 13th century</a> and typifies the kinds of edge cases that begin to appear as the network snakes out of the oldest records of rulers and their heirs. Before the 9th century, there were not enough detours into related and notable actors and their relations to see very low centrality numbers. The other cluster is from the <a class='focusAction' onclick='moveTimeline(1000,1650,20);'>17th to the 20th century</a>, and is typical of the grandparents and cousins that are included in Kindred Britain almost as an afterthought. Kindred Britain was created by finding paths from one notable individual to another, with some of the relatives of the individuals also added to the database, and as a result the least central people tend to be the little-known relatives of these tenuously connected notables. A telltale sign in these cases is a dearth of events—these are individuals for whom we often only know of their marrying or giving birth to someone more connected to British culture and history. The scant geographic details we have about their place of birth or death, or that of their more central spouses, children, or parents, leaves little in the way of remarkable patterns: Anne Hewlett and Thomas Cushman both had a tie to Massachusetts, while Mary Maria Adams and Emily Cecilia Jones both had a significantly less surprising tie to London.</p><p>Notice that in most cases these individuals, along with being not closely related to the rest of Kindred Britain as a whole, are also not very closely related to each other. If you try to connect one to the other, the paths can be quite circuitous. They are, for the most part, not even in the same remote area of the network, which will not be the case with some of the centrality values we look at later. The average distance between these individuals is 35, with the longest distance a massive 60 steps and the shortest apart of 5 steps.</p><p>It is in royal ties that those few shortest routes between least central individuals deviate from the norm. The two 5 step paths occur from Herfast de Crepon to Ralph the Staller Earl of East Anglia and the 5 steps separating Rodrigo II from the Holy Roman Empress Matilda. Note that the people connecting these individuals are significantly more central. By definition, the more connected an individual is, the higher their centrality rating would be by most measures, and so least-connected people need to find their way to more connected people to trace a genealogical path to a distant individual.</p>",
            "<p>I will now consider some of the different ways in which centrality can be measured. None of these is the definitive measurement for this concept: each is a valid way of proceeding and offers different insights. There are four measures we use, which are aggregated to provide an overall centrality referred to in part 1. We'll examine the top 20 individuals who were found to be central by each of these scores to better understand the kind of centrality they represent.</p><p>The first specific centrality measure we'll look at is network closeness. Closeness Centrality is a score based on the average distance to everyone else in a network from an individual, and as such points to a literal center of the network. In this case, that center is a group made up of 13 women and dominated by a single family. Of the 7 men in this group, <a class='focusAction' onclick='setActive(\"nBPr\",\"netProfessionButton\");setActive(\"nBF\",\"netLayoutButton\");freeNodes();setTimeout(\"addHull()\", focusClickDelay)'>6 of them are in politics</a> in some way or another, with the only non-politician male being the 5th Duke of Devonshire, whose two daughters are married to politicians and whose sister-in-law was the first wife of his daughter Harriet's husband. The seemingly disconnected Lady Caroline is the niece of the father of Duke William's son-in-law.</p><p>The entirety of the rest of the Kindred Britain network is, on average, less than 12 steps from the small group of individuals shown here. This is only a representative sample, though, with 100 other individuals being less than 12 steps, on average, from the rest of the network. Closeness centrality provides the most similar measure to travel. If you were to think of Kindred Britain as a network of places instead of people, and were interested in finding the shortest path from one individual to the entirety of the network, this measure shows that. But closeness ignores the fact that not all individuals in a network are equally important from one perspective or another, which is revealed in the following measures.</p><p>One way to measure the value of centrality measures is to evaluate whether the individuals rated highly by one measure are rated highly by others. This comparison between specific measures, such as closeness, and the aggregated centrality measure represented in Kindred Britain, can give clues as to what genealogical strategies might maximize centrality from a network perspective. Of the top 20 individuals according to closeness, 2 of them are among the 10 most central overall in the entire network (John Leveson-Gower and Granville Leveson-Gower), 4 of them are in the top 100, 10 are in the top 1000, and 4 are in the top 10,000 most central.</p>",
            "<p>Eigenvector centrality derives its evaluation of nodes in a network from the pooling or accreting of connectedness of individual nodes. As a result, nodes that are connected to nodes that have many connections are considered more central than nodes that are connected to nodes that have few connections. Someone like Erasmus Darwin, who had many children and many spouses, who themselves have large families, would score higher than someone who was in the densest part of the network but only connected to one or two other individuals who themselves were only connected to one or two individuals. Eignenvector centrality, like closeness, provides a reasonable 'center' to the network, in this case dominated by a <a class='focusAction' onclick='toggleDisplay(\"searchShare\");'>different family group</a>, the Fanes.</p><p>Unlike the Leveson-Gowers that dominate Closeness, though, the Fanes represent no particular profession or activity sphere, and neither the Honorable Henry Fane nor his wife Anne Batson are deeply connected to the Kindred Britain network in a way that royalty or well-established surnames are. Eigenvector centrality, like many of these measures, was developed to better understand social networks based on kith ties, with the reasoning being that someone with many connections socially to highly connected people is more powerful than one with many connections to less connected people. We can see the genealogical version of these social ties in our example to the right. One Fane daughter marries a Chaplin who is well-established, but otherwise it is the number of children who go on to either be or be married to cultural elites. The large, important families from these lines are compounded by the ties established by Henry Fane's brother, whose great-great granddaughter, Ethel Anne Priscilla Fane, marries into the Grenfell line.</p><p>All of these centrality measures are undirected, and so the pooling of connectivity runs in both directions. In this way, the Fanes benefit from having many connections into the most connected areas of the Kindred Britain network, both forward and backward in time. This concept of centrality runs askew from our traditional understanding of genealogy, which either moves backward using ancestry for legitimacy and accumulated esteem, or forward in terms of alliance.</p><p>Interestingly, none of the top ten most central overall individuals are represented among these high Eigenvector centrality individuals, only two of the top 100, and the remaining 18 are split evenly between the top 1000 and top 10,000 most central overall.</p>",
            "<p>Like Eigenvector Centrality, the basic PageRank algorithm used to determine network centrality also accumulates connectedness, but with a notable difference: It does not add the connectedness of nodes in the entire network but rather only those in a local area. The conceptual basis for this measure is to simulate the browsing of Internet websites (represented as nodes) based on the links between them (represented as edges) over a fixed period of “clicks”. For a network like Kindred Britain, this means that PageRank will start  at any individual in the network, and randomly move from that individual to their spouse, parents, siblings or children, and continue on like this for a few steps. The algorithm then restarts on another individual and goes on like this.</p><p>The result of this is an emphasis on highly-connected individuals in the densest local areas of the network. It <a class='focusAction' onclick='setActive(\"nBPr\",\"netProfessionButton\");setActive(\"nBF\",\"netLayoutButton\");freeNodes();setTimeout(\"addHull()\", focusClickDelay)'>includes royalty and those involved in the arts</a> like Tony Curtis and Rupert Murdoch. Of the ten most central individuals overall, two of them are represented here: James II and Charles II. They represent in Kindred Britain the gatekeepers between two different ages of British culture, with genealogical browsing that starts in either area having a reasonable likelihood of landing on one or both. Besides these two, the remaining individuals on display here include two from the top 100, 4 from the top 1000, 11 from the top 10,000 and one, <a class='focusAction' onclick='highlightNode(\"I14837\")'>Tony Curtis</a>, who falls in the middle category of neither central nor peripheral members of this genealogical network.</p>",
            "<p>Betweenness highlights individuals in the network that are along the most paths between one and another individual in the network. Betweenness was developed to better understand the importance of scientific papers in the development of meaningful research. Using this method, researchers can discover which papers were key to particular lines of research that produced many later papers by creating a citation network of papers that reference each other. Betweenness reveals that a paper that might have had few citations was still key to the research produced in many, later papers. In Kindred Britain, the individuals with the highest scores all were born during a 300 year period and are often connected with each other (these being high-traffic paths through the network).</p><p>While there is no dominant profession, there are <a class='focusAction' onclick='colorByAttribute(\"tragedy\",[\"#CCFF99\",\"#5CAD5C\",\"#336600\"])'>significantly higher tragedy scores</a> as a result of multiple marriages and large families. This intuitively matches up with the evaluation of marriages and family size as establishing and cementing the power of individuals in these groups in the social sphere.</p><p>Betweenness reinforces some of the centrality signals given by PageRank and Closeness, with three of the top ten most central individuals being represented to the right. Two of them are James II and Charles II, seen at the top of the PageRank centrality, and the other is Granville Leveson-Gower, who is one of the most central according to Closeness. Betweenness also skews more toward the higher overall centrality individuals, with 4 in the top 100, 10 in the top 1000 and 3 in the top 10,000.</p>",
            "<p>In some ways, the use of network centrality measures in genealogical networks reveals patterns that support traditional views of genealogy. Royalty acts as a kind of axial spine, with documented pedigrees serving as high-traffic paths through the network. Large numbers of offspring provide more than the simplistic “added farmhands” that typically explain historical family size, rather they act not only to maintain family lines against increased mortality, but also to be used in a social networking sense to increase centrality in a genealogical network. Marrying into documented lineages provides the capacity to invoke family relations and familiar language in achieving social and cultural capital. But other forms of strategic marriage, especially in the form of multiple (whether serial or parallel) marriage, also increase the likelihood that the individual and their family will be more connected and that those connections will be more visible.</p><p>But more than reaffirming and formalizing known familial structures within a network analysis framework, Kindred Britain gives us the chance to envision differing strategies for and multiple definitions of success by comparing the winners and losers of British history according to different network centrality measures. While the database is not exhaustive enough to do more than gesture toward this approach, it would benefit from a close reading of the historical strategies and structures. One such structure to explore is a comparison of the Leveson-Gowers and the Fanes, to see if these two families typify more than two different centrality measures. Another is the place of Charles II and James II as described from a royal perspective focused on the strength of their royal pedigrees contrasted with their use among colonial English elites in their own attempts to establish and legitimize their family structures.</p><p>Centrality measures developed within the theoretical frameworks of particular types of networks, such as web pages or social networks, but turn out to be useful for understanding very different network structures, such as family trees. With the growth of genealogical data available for such analysis, we can expect to see more specific measures that focus on the aspects that make genealogy different from these other kinds of networks, such as patrilineage and matrilineage or the comparative strength of marriage ties to lineage ties. In light of the lack of such measures, we decided to aggregate four different measures used in other areas in the hope that it would provide a more schematic view of generic centrality.</p><p>With the growth of network science, taking this kind of approach to the enormous amount of available genealogical data will only become more common both among scholars and the general public.</p>"

            "<p>In a vast botanical poem in rhyming couplets, <span class='emphasize'>The Loves of the Plants</span> (1789), Erasmus Darwin (1731-1802) articulated a vision emphasizing prodigality, fertility, change, copiousness. Above all, the poem stresses – through its examination of &lsquo;unallowe&rsquo;d desires&rsquo; and &lsquo;illicit loves&rsquo; as much as orthodox botanical &lsquo;marriages&rsquo; – the centrality to life of incessant reproduction. Here is how Maureen McNeil describes Darwin&rsquo;s thought in her entry on this &lsquo;physician and natural philosopher&rsquo; in the <span class='emphasize'>Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</span>:</p><p class='indented'>His pictorial representations and use of personification and pathetic fallacy intensified the Linnaean view of plant sexuality in which stamens are represented as men and pistils as women: lovers, brides, husbands, courtships, and pregnancies abound. <span class='emphasize'>The Loves of the Plants</span> was Erasmus Darwin's first substantial exploration of what he considered to be key features of the natural world: the importance of reproduction and the continuities or analogies between the functioning of the vegetable and the animal worlds.</p><p>In thinking about such analogies between the worlds of plants and people, Darwin&rsquo;s own circumstances, both in terms of <a class='focusAction' onclick='setActive(\"nBPr\",\"netProfessionButton\");setActive(\"nBF\",\"netLayoutButton\");freeNodes();setTimeout(\"addHull()\", focusClickDelay)'>his familial and his professional</a> associations, become an inescapable mirror for his philosophy.  The idea of promiscuous interconnections between organisms (and also between the spheres of poetry and science) that strongly marks Darwin&rsquo;s intellectual worldview finds analogies in his own &lsquo;marriages&rsquo; and &lsquo;illicit loves&rsquo;. Or is it that the marriages and illicit loves find analogies in his worldview? In either case, the parallels allow us to reflect on the intricate relations within Darwin&rsquo;s world between the culture of family and the family of culture.</p>",
            "<p>Like his personal life, Darwin&rsquo;s professional life had multiple dimensions. His poems describe a blended, heterogeneous cosmos in which &lsquo;supernatural agents such as nymphs, gnomes, sylphs, and salamanders&rsquo; mingle with ordinary &lsquo;men of industry and science&rsquo; (McNeil again). Likewise, Darwin&rsquo;s medical work (Midlands&rsquo; towns) took in all sorts. While he centered his practice primarily on the wealthier echelons of the middle class, and in particular on the families of &lsquo;men of industry and science&rsquo;, his work also brought him into contact with the working class and with the aristocratic rich. Darwin hoped to establish a dispensary for Derby&rsquo;s poor; yet on occasion he also treated people of &lsquo;family, fortune and consequence&rsquo;, such as the Countess of Northesk. He may even have been asked for help by the mad king George III – a request that Darwin apparently managed to turned down.</p>",
            "<p>Darwin himself sprang from a solidly bourgeois background: his great-great grandfather, Erasmus Earle, was serjeant-at-law for Oliver Cromwell. His father, Robert Darwin, was a wealthy Nottingham lawyer who retired early.</p><p>Erasmus Darwin was twice married and eventually had at least 14 children (three of whom were illegitimate) from two marriages and from two non-marital liaisons. Socially speaking, his first union was relatively conventional for his time. His wife was Mary Howard, who came from a similar background to her husband&rsquo;s, being the daughter of a solicitor from Lichfield. <a class='focusAction' onclick='setActive(\"colorT\",\"colorButton\");colorByAttribute(\"tragedy\",[\"#CCFF99\",\"#5CAD5C\",\"#336600\"])'>Death was omnipresent in their family</a>, even though at its head was a man whose professional goal was to preserve life. Mary Howard died in 1770 at the age of 30 and, though the couple had five children, only three of them survived to adulthood. Erasmus Darwin was outlived by only one of these three children, Robert Waring Darwin, a doctor and the father of Charles Darwin; the future promulgator of evolutionary theory emerged into the world in a survivor&rsquo;s family.</p><p>But if the Darwin &lsquo;line&rsquo; was death-haunted when understood in the context of Erasmus Darwin&rsquo;s family history, it was extraordinarily vital in an intellectual sense. Erasmus, along with his son, Robert, and grandson, Charles, as well as another grandson, Francis Galton, and three of Erasmus&rsquo;s great-grandsons, George Darwin, Francis Darwin and Horace Darwin, were all elected Fellows of the Royal Society. It would be hard to think of another family in Britain that amassed, perhaps even hoarded, such scientific prestige across the generations.</p>",
            "<p>Though the pair could not marry until after Elizabeth&rsquo;s soldier husband died in 1780, the widowed but amorous Darwin had been smitten with Elizabeth Pole since 1775. That year the experienced doctor and man of science became so love-struck that he took up poetry again (writing &lsquo;Speech of a Wood-Nymph&rsquo;) after many years of lyric silence. Their relationship budded and the pair wed in 1781. Their marriage involved slightly <a class='focusAction' onclick='divLayout.network=\"none\";divLayout.map=\"none\";divLayout.timeline=\"full\";resizePanes();'>less of a disjunction in ages</a> than Elizabeth&rsquo;s first union had (her new husband was 49 and she was 34). It lasted over two decades until Darwin&rsquo;s death in 1802. The couple produced seven children, the fruits and blooms of their love, six of whom survived childhood and then outlived their father.</p>",
            "<p>Darwin&rsquo;s second marriage was a contrast to his first not only with respect to the robustness and resilience of the family&rsquo;s offspring, but also to the <a class='focusAction' onclick='setActive(\"colorD\",\"colorButton\");colorByAttribute(\"parentless\",[\"#CCFF99\",\"#5CAD5C\",\"#336600\"])'>enhanced social standing</a> the union brought him. Elizabeth Pole, Darwin's second wife, was the illegitimate daughter of Charles Colyear, 2nd Earl of Portmore. She was thus the granddaughter of Catharine Sedley, Countess of Dorchester, who was a mistress of James II. Elizabeth had first encountered Erasmus Darwin when he treated the children of her marriage to Colonel Edward Sacheverel Pole, a professional soldier from the Derbyshire gentry who had lost an eye at the Battle of Minden in 1759. Elizabeth and Edward&rsquo;s May-September marriage in 1769 (she was 22, he was 51) produced four children before the colonel died in 1780.</p><p>Darwin would probably never have met Elizabeth Pole, had he not established a reputation among the midlands gentry and aristocracy for medical competence. He first met Elizabeth in a professional context mediated through the cash nexus, but their eventual marriage, subsequently allied with the success of his increasingly ambitious and widely publicized writings (all of which date from the years after his marriage to the aristocratically-connected Elizabeth), transformed his social standing. Indeed, through his second wife, Darwin was to establish distant familial links with some of the aristocrats, such as the Countess of Northesk, who, like her, had visited him for treatment. Those whom he had once consulted with as a professional subsequently became his remote kindred.</p><p>So great were the social pretensions bred into some members of the Pole/Colyear family that Erasmus Darwin&rsquo;s step-son, Sacheverel Pole, later petitioned to have his surname changed to Chandos-Pole in memory of a 14th century ancestor, Sir John Chandos, one of the founder members of the elite chivalric order of the Knights of the Garter, mortally wounded in the face by a stab-wound in France in 1369. Erasmus Darwin, the originator of a bourgeois scientific dynasty, married into a family imbued with aristocratic airs.</p>",
            "<p>Such is the &lsquo;official&rsquo; family history of Erasmus Darwin. But alongside, and intertwined with these legally-sanctioned relationships between husband and wife, parents and child, there were other strands of connection that can be described as forming the &lsquo;dark networks&rsquo; of relationship within Darwin&rsquo;s life. These were the shadowy relations created by the children that he fathered during forays outside the institution of marriage, although he does not appear to have denied or hidden his paternity of illegitimate children. As noted above, he fathered 14 children, three of whom were apparently born &lsquo;naturally&rsquo; to two separate mothers. (A &lsquo;natural&rsquo; child, is, as the <span class='emphasize'>OED</span> explains, one &lsquo;related genetically but not legally to his or her father; born outside marriage, illegitimate&rsquo;.) His own polymorphous love-life was a bit like the love-lives of the plants he wrote about. Around the time of his first wife&rsquo;s death, Darwin entered into a relationship with a married woman, Lucy Swift. A daughter was born in mid-1771 with Darwin usually considered to have been her father. This daughter, also called Lucy Swift, shared her natural father&rsquo;s fascination with botany and she shared some of his intellectual affiliations along with his didacticism, too. For example, she was the author of <span class='emphasize'>An Introduction to the Elements of the Linnean System of Botany</span> (1830) and she ran a school in Derby.</p><p>Indeed, through his daughter, the second Lucy Swift (who, in 1792, married a Derby man named John Hardcastle), Darwin&rsquo;s botanical obsessions exfoliated into a set of important connections with a whole branch of eminent botanists from a slightly later period. For example, the physician and botanist Francis Boott was the scion of an Anglo-American family with strong connections to Derby. Boott spent time in Derby in the early years of the 19th century. He probably originally acquired his interest in botany from his father Kirk Boott, a Derby native who owned one of the earliest greenhouses in his adopted home city of Boston. But Francis Boott may also have deepened his interest in plants in Derby under the tutelage of Lucy Hardcastle, Darwin&rsquo;s illegitimate daughter and author of a textbook on the Linnean system. And – reinforcing the connection – Mary Hardcastle, Lucy&rsquo;s daughter, Erasmus Darwin&rsquo;s probable granddaughter, married Boott in 1820.</p><p>The Boott connection added a transatlantic branch to the Darwin tree. Francis Boott was the Vice-President of the Linnean Society in London between 1861 and 1863 and the author of an authoritative four-volume work on sedges. His brothers, Wright Boott, James Boott and William Boott were all keen horticulturalists and members of the Boston Society of Natural History. In particular Wright Boott, an eccentric and reclusive character who ended up shooting himself in 1845, was an eminent New World cultivator of orchids.</p><p>The long, delicate tendrils of family ties in this story extend across space and time. Erasmus Darwin&rsquo;s grandson, Charles Darwin, published <span class='emphasize'>On the Origin of Species</span> in 1859. His next book, and his first attempt to show in detail how the principle of natural selection operates, was <span class='emphasize'>On the various contrivances by which British and foreign orchids are fertilised by insects, and on the good effects of intercrossing</span> (1862). Given Charles Darwin&rsquo;s connection to Francis and Wright Boott, who were the husband and brother-in-law of Darwin&rsquo;s natural cousin, Mary Hardcastle, the book on orchids, with its praise for fertilization by &lsquo;intercrossing&rsquo;, emanates a subtly elegiac, familial fragrance. By the 1860s, orchids had become a plant associated with both the legitimate and illegitimate branches of Erasmus Darwin&rsquo;s descendants.</p>",
            "<p>Wright Boott, the orchid-grower, whose full name was John Wright Boott, was apparently named after his father Kirk&rsquo;s friend John Wright, the nephew of the artist Joseph Wright, who is usually known as Joseph Wright of Derby. Joseph Wright of Derby was a node through which many connections to and from Erasmus Darwin pass. Wright painted Darwin at least twice and Darwin treated the artist for asthma and dropsy. The Wright and Boott families in Derby seem to have been closely connected. Joseph Wright painted Mary Turnaley, the wife of Kirk Boott&rsquo;s great-nephew, another Francis Boott. He also painted the Derby-born Ann Haden, who married the American industrialist Kirk Boott II, a brother of the botanist Francis Boott (see above). As it happens, Wright had also painted and sketched Ann&rsquo;s father, Thomas Haden, when he was a young man. When Erasmus Darwin retired around 1801 it was Thomas Haden, twice a mayor of Derby, an alderman and a doctor, who took over Darwin&rsquo;s medical practice. In this world, almost every intellectual or business affiliation seems to carry with it somewhere a family backstory.</p>",
            "<p>At about the time that Erasmus Darwin&rsquo;s relationship with Lucy Swift ended, he became enamoured of Mary Parker, whom he had engaged as a governess for his son Robert Waring Darwin (Charles Darwin&rsquo;s father). This affair produced a further two illegitimate daughters, Susanna Parker and Mary Parker. Sometime around 1775 the &lsquo;association&rsquo; (to use the genealogical jargon) between Darwin and Mary Parker came to an end, at about the point Darwin fell in love with the still-married Elizabeth Pole. So far as the historical record is concerned, all Darwin&rsquo;s subsequent children were born legitimately.</p><p>In time, and like their natural sister Lucy Swift, Susanna and Mary Parker would also be involved in running a school. Although Darwin had moved into a more elevated social station with his marriage to Elizabeth Pole, he tried to help his illegitimate Parker daughters in their endeavours, for example publishing at their instigation in 1797 a volume of supervisory advice for young woman engaged in the business of schooling: <span class='emphasize'>A Plan for the Conduct of Female Education, in Boarding Schools</span>. All Darwin&rsquo;s natural children worked for a living outside the home in a way that his legitimate daughters never did. The only one of his daughters who was an author was the illegitimate Lucy Swift.</p><p>Darwin&rsquo;s &lsquo;natural&rsquo; children, fathered with Lucy Swift and Mary Parker, introduce new dimensions of class and gender into any account of &lsquo;family&rsquo; in Erasmus Darwin&rsquo;s personal history. For instance, as we have seen, Lucy Swift&rsquo;s life story was intimately formed by her father&rsquo;s love of botany and it was through her that Darwin&rsquo;s history links up with the Anglo-American botanical dynasty of the Boott family. Darwin&rsquo;s familial connections did not spread out like the dully unnatural sticks and branches trained at perfect right-angles in a traditionally-drawn, and impeccably conventional, family &lsquo;tree&rsquo;. Instead his personal history looks more like an image of spiralling and twisting stalks sent out by one of the polyphiloprogenitive plants that he wrote about enthusiastically.</p>",
            "<p>Moving, as <span class='emphasize'>Kindred Britain</span> does, beyond the limited ambitions (and capacities) of the orthodox genealogical diagram, it becomes possible to see a dense world of familial linkages, hitherto largely invisible or at best ignored, that colour and perhaps even structure some of Erasmus Darwin&rsquo;s intellectual affiliations. For example, Darwin&rsquo;s best-known set of relationships with other industrialists and experimenters in the 18th century Midlands is mediated through the Lunar Society of Birmingham. The Society was established in the city around 1765 and became most intensely active in the period between 1781 and 1791 when, after the Lunar Society had welcomed the French Revolution, a Birmingham mob sacked the house and laboratory of Lunar Society member Joseph Priestley and destroyed Priestley&rsquo;s Unitarian New Meeting House.</p><p>It has been commonplace to think of the Lunar Society&rsquo;s members in terms of their shared mercantile, reforming and industrial interests and their commitment to experimentation whether in education or steam engines. But these intellectual ties were suggestively subtended or consolidated by a set of personal, familial associations.</p><p>Sometimes it seems that the family connections were created by membership of the Lunar Society. For example, the ceramicist and businessman Josiah Wedgwood met Darwin in the early 1760s when Wedgwood was lobbying for the construction of the Trent-Mersey canal. Wedgwood became strongly involved with Lunar Society activities and the society&rsquo;s members influenced his own experiments and commercial undertakings. Thus, Wedgwood took the Soho works of Lunar Society member and entrepreneur Matthew Boulton as the model for his manufacturing plant the Etruria Works in Stoke-on-Trent on the path of the Trent-Mersey canal. Darwin suggested the name to Wedgwood (the place had previously been known as the Ridgehouse Estate) and presumably also the motto for the complex, &lsquo;Artes Etruriae renascuntur&rsquo; (&lsquo;The arts of Etruria are reborn&rsquo;), in allusion to the excavations of Etruscan pottery then being conducted in Tuscany.</p><p>These working associations were later sealed by the 1796 marriage of Darwin&rsquo;s son Robert Waring Darwin to Wedgwood&rsquo;s eldest daughter Susannah Wedgwood. These were the future parents of Charles Darwin. Darwin was later to marry his cousin (and Josiah Wedgwood&rsquo;s granddaughter), Emma Wedgwood. Commentators such as Maureen McNeil have linked the evolutionary theories of Charles Darwin to speculations he found in his grand-father&rsquo;s works: &lsquo;Early exposure to the ideas of [Erasmus Darwin&rsquo;s] Zoonomia was crucial in Charles's formulation of his theory of evolution.&rsquo; But, equally, it was the pottery wealth that flowed into the Darwin family through intermarriages with the Wedgwoods that provided the material basis for Charles Darwin&rsquo;s long, meditative retreats during which he worked on his transformative books. Without the Lunar Society, it seems unlikely that Charles Darwin would have been wealthy enough to pursue his theories independently and at length.</p>",
            "<p>Other intellectual or business relationships that Darwin had with industrialists and reformers in 18th century Britain were later strengthened or perpetuated through marriage. Thus <span class='emphasize'>Kindred Britain</span> can show the familial links between Darwin and the Derbyshire politician Samuel Crompton, the industrialist Sir Richard Arkwright, and Lunar Society member and educationalist Thomas Day. Indeed of the 13 core members of the Lunar Society, <span class='emphasize'>Kindred Britain</span> demonstrates family links between 10: Darwin, Wedgwood, Boulton, Day, Priestley, the engineer and educationalist Richard Lovell Edgeworth, the Quaker arms manufacturer Samuel Galton, the chemist James Keir, the engineer and scientist James Watt and the physician William Withering. (The only central members of the Lunar Society not, or not yet, present in the <span class='emphasize'>Kindred Britain</span> database are William Small, Jonathan Stokes and John Whitehurst.)</p><p><span class='emphasize'>Kindred Britain</span> not only visualizes the familial links that connect intellectual and business partners. It can also, more subversively, expose chains of kin and relation between antagonists as well. For example, Withering and Erasmus Darwin engaged in the most serious personal dispute that arose between members of the Lunar Society. Darwin had sporadically experimented on patients with heart conditions by treating them with the drug <span class='emphasize'>digitalis</span>, which is extracted from foxgloves. He also hurried into print in 1785 an article written by his son Robert Waring Darwin on the use of the medicine. Only a short while later Withering published his long-considered and far more systematic <span class='emphasize'>An Account of the Foxglove and some of its Medical Uses, &c.</span></p><p>Withering took offense at what he considered Darwin&rsquo;s effort to pre-empt his claim to be the first physician to use digitalis in his medical practice. This initial dispute deepened over succeeding years until Withering and Darwin were deeply alienated, not knowing that sometime in the future, a family relationship between them would be established by their descendants&rsquo; intermarriage. Other enemies of Erasmus Darwin&rsquo;s with whom he shared a prospective family connection include the conservative political parodists George Canning (later briefly Prime Minister) and J. H. Frere who together in <span class='emphasize'>The Anti-Jacobin</span>, a pro-government periodical, lampooned Darwin&rsquo;s poetry and ideas towards the end of the doctor&rsquo;s life. Yet Canning and Frere were to become retrospectively connected to Darwin through the marriage in 1822 of the banker Daniel Gurney to Lady Jemima Hay. (Gurney was a cousin of Darwin&rsquo;s son-in-law, Samuel Tertius Galton.)</p>",
            "<p>These connections developed between former foes suggest five important truths about English cultural life. The first is that family history is not just a matter of tracing direct, lineal modes of descent, linking, for example, the 18th century doctor and poet Erasmus Darwin to the scientist Charles Darwin or even to the 2nd Lieutenant Erasmus Darwin (a great-great grandson of the 18th century doctor) who died at Ypres in 1915. It also involves tracing the &lsquo;dark&rsquo; or shadowy networks of unofficial or illegitimate relations that have played only a small part in the transmission of property but such a large part in the passing on of artistic and intellectual passions.</p><p>The second truth that consideration of Darwin&rsquo;s family connections suggests is that lateral, intellectual affiliations of the kinds traced here between the eminent middle ranks of society and Lunar Society members are sometimes underwritten by family ties. If these ties are not explicitly known or even extant, then they seem to be part of a matrix of expectation in which everyone in a certain world could at least be imagined as becoming a relation in the future. The third is that (as in the case of the intermarriages of the Darwin and Wedgwood families) intellectual affiliations sometimes create significant family ties, leading to further important cultural production. A fourth is that intellectual or political oppositions are often dissolved or reconciled by eventual family linkages, just as emergent men of wealth who arose out of the profiteering rampant during the Industrial Revolution and were sometimes considered a latent threat to the old aristocratic order, were often absorbed by marriage into the nobility&rsquo;s older structures of power which they might have seemed to put in jeopardy.</p><p>Lastly, there is a fifth truth to be gleaned from the consideration of Erasmus Darwin&rsquo;s complicated networks of kin and intellect. It is a truth that <span class='emphasize'>Kindred Britain</span> offers up again and again in narrative form. The truth is that, to an extraordinary and perhaps troubling degree, generation after generation of a certain section of English life seems to have concentrated on keeping the businesses of culture and intellect, like the old silver, the land and the ancestral portraits, firmly &lsquo;in the family&rsquo;. How positive the results of these dynastic inheritances have been is a question to which there is no simple answer.</p>"

Against the background of disorder and loss of control, and perhaps because the realities of conflict are so hard to grasp, to endure or to represent, rivals often emerge like emblems of the opposing groups. The rivals offer both participants and observers a clarification of the historical process. Personal aspirations for power between two domineering enemies, often as much preoccupied with each other as with the object or position they apparently contend for, are superimposed onto shadowy ideological causes or vast bands of soldiers. The classic rivalries are political and military: Pitt and Fox, Gladstone and Disraeli, Cromwell and Charles I. (All these rival pairings are visualized in <span class='emphasize'>Kindred Britain</span>.) But the rivalry paradigm also recurs in almost every other field of human activity, not least in love.</p><p>Rivalry is not a chance or unstructured phenomenon but one that is produced by a set of rules, conventions and codes. These rules of rivalry help the counterparts to recognize one another and be recognized. Rivals are pitted against each other in a sustained conflict in which, usually, the antagonists draw legitimacy from some larger issue or group of people. But although the stakes in a rivalry can be high, there is at the same time something theatrical and melodramatic, perhaps even stereotypical, about rivalry. It is if the rivals were characters taking part in a play that scripted their actions for them. Just as hate is an obsessive relationship to another person curiously akin to its apparent opposite, love, so rivalry is the strongly complementary antithesis to its supposed opposite, partnership. Indeed, rivals are interdependent and related in their identities: they need each other to exist. And, as <span class='emphasize'>Kindred Britain</span> shows, rivals are sometimes &lsquo;related&rsquo; in a more literal sense as well.</p>",
            "<p>After several years of inconclusive conflict, the military rivals Major General George Washington (1732-1799) and Lieutenant General Charles Cornwallis, or Earl Cornwallis (1738-1805), confronted one another when Washington&rsquo;s army pinned down his noble rival&rsquo;s army at Yorktown, Virginia in late September 1781. The French navy had closed Cornwallis&rsquo;s escape route to the Atlantic. In early October, Washington himself fired the first shot in the bombardment of Yorktown. A little later, when the Americans spotted a large house within the British position, they guessed that Cornwallis might be stationed there and they targeted it. Within a few days the British position became impossible to sustain and it became expedient for Cornwallis to surrender. The two commanders exchanged letters full of ritualized courtesies. In the prelude to the Articles of Capitulation, Cornwallis, the lord, referred to Washington as &lsquo;His Excellency&rsquo; and signed himself (perhaps ironically) &lsquo;Your most obedient and humble Servant.&rsquo; In his letters Washington addressed Cornwallis as &lsquo;your Lordship&rsquo; and, as if correcting Cornwallis&rsquo;s fuzzy English, subscribed himself &lsquo;Your Lordship&rsquo;s Most obedient & Most humble Servant&rsquo; (my italics).</p><p>Military surrenders, like rivalries generally, involved ceremony and symbolism. Swords that might have crossed instead had to change hands. So bitter was the defeat for the British, that when the time came for the formal relinquishment of the commanding officer&rsquo;s sword, Cornwallis could not bring himself to be present even though it was his own weapon that was to be transferred to the Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army.  Instead, he sent out his second-in-command, Charles O&rsquo;Hara, to meet Washington and the American army&rsquo;s French allies. O&rsquo;Hara, whether from confusion or malice, wanted to surrender to the French officer-in-charge:</p><p class='indented'>O&rsquo;Hara asked for Rochambeau, and Dumas directed him to the head of the French column arrayed west of Hampton Road facing east toward the line of Americans. &lsquo;Guessing his intention,&rsquo; recalled Dumas, &lsquo;I galloped on to place myself between him and M. de Rochambeau, who at that moment made me a sign, pointing to General Washington who was opposite to him.&rsquo; O&rsquo;Hara knew Washington was the commander of the Allied army, and his intent to either slight the Virginian or avoid him altogether was unsuccessful, for Rochambeau would have none of it. Dumas conducted O&rsquo;Hara across the road to where Washington was waiting. O&rsquo;Hara apologized for the error and for Cornwallis&rsquo;s absence from the ceremony. According to at least one account, the British general extended Cornwallis&rsquo;s sword for Washington&rsquo;s acceptance. The Allied commander demurred. &lsquo;Never from such a good hand,&rsquo; he said, and referred O&rsquo;Hara to Benjamin Lincoln. If Cornwallis was going to send a subordinate to surrender, O&rsquo;Hara could surrender to a subordinate.</p><p class='indented'>(Jerome Greene, <span class='emphasize'>Guns of Independence: The Siege of Yorktown, 1781</span> (2009) p. 297)</p><p>Washington&rsquo;s clever, theatrical gesture emphasized that he was the equal of Earl Cornwallis, an idea that had an obvious military logic to it, since Washington&rsquo;s troops had overcome the troops under Cornwallis&rsquo;s command. But it also suggested he believed there was a social parity as well. In the immediate context, Washington was operating as a colleague with French aristocrats such as General Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau, commander of the French troops who were Washington&rsquo;s allies (and his fellow rivals of the British). Thus, when O&rsquo;Hara tried to give up Cornwallis&rsquo;s sword to a French aristocrat rather than a Virginia planter, Rochambeau &lsquo;made me a sign, pointing to General Washington who was opposite to him.&rsquo;</p>",
            "<p>In fact, as many observers noticed, throughout his adult life Washington had a semi-Europeanized, aristocratic demeanour. At his estates in Virginia he played the part of the lord of the manor, visiting his tenant farmers and supervising the financial exploitation of his properties. He owned an expensive carriage, made in London. And, once he had become president of the United States, observers found something &lsquo;kingly&rsquo; in the atmosphere around him.</p><p>The rivals Cornwallis and Washington, even as they might seem to have been diametrically opposed, crashing against each other&rsquo;s forces like two charging bulls, nonetheless shared an obvious tincture of sameness. The word &lsquo;rival&rsquo; comes from the Latin &lsquo;rivalis&rsquo; meaning originally a &lsquo;person living on the opposite bank of a stream from another&rsquo;. And from that idea of two people mutually observing each other, bound together by living in one place and competing for the same scarce resources, by metaphoric extension came the notion of a &lsquo;person who is in pursuit of the same object as another&rsquo; (<span class='emphasize'>OED</span>). Thus, one complementary ancient meaning of the term was actually the opposite of the familiar modern one. When, in the first scene of <span class='emphasize'>Hamlet</span>, Barnardo speaks about the &lsquo;rivals of my watch&rsquo;, he means not his enemies but the men who were to stand guard alongside him, his comrades. A &lsquo;rival&rsquo; could be a friend as well as an enemy; perhaps in fact all rivals share something. In the case of Washington and Cornwallis, one factor in the enigmatic sameness that binds rivals together could be related to their shared ancestry.</p><p>At the time of the American Revolution the language of family often emerged in speeches about the conflict. British politicians spoke about the &lsquo;obedience which a colony owes to its mother country&rsquo;. George III likened himself to the &lsquo;father&rsquo; of his peoples, including the colonists. In 1775 Edmund Burke, generally sympathetic to the American predicament, talked about the &lsquo;close affection which grows from common names, from kindred blood, from similar privileges, and equal protection. These are ties which, though light as air, are as strong as links of iron.&rsquo; The discourse of the struggle, at least on the British side, often crystallized around ideas about the unnaturalness of breaking family &lsquo;ties&rsquo; and obligations. But these powerful (and simplifying) metaphors were underwritten by an obvious truth: many of the colonists were not far away from being part of a British family.</p>",
            "<p>George Washington, the rebel against the crown, was a lineal descendant of John Sutton, the 1st Baron Dudley, a Knight of the Garter. Dudley had been chief mourner and standard-bearer at the funeral of England&rsquo;s hero-king Henry V, and had later switched sides with alacrity during the rebellion against Richard III. (The <span class='emphasize'>ODNB</span> calls Sutton one of the &lsquo;great political survivors&rsquo; of the 15th century.) In fact, <span class='emphasize'>Kindred Britain</span> shows that George Washington and the officer whose army he defeated at Georgetown were distant cousins. What is more, when news of Cornwallis&rsquo;s surrender reached the ears of the British prime minister, Lord North, the chief proponent of Britain&rsquo;s attempt to suppress the rebellion in America, North &lsquo;staggered as if shot and cried out: “Oh God! It is all over”.&rsquo; Although probably neither was aware of the fact, Washington was a distant cousin of North too. And the mad king, George III, whose chief servant North was? He and George Washington were also related by shared ancestry and, looking into the future, would also become united by future family ties. Secreted within the apparently radical antagonisms and enmities conventionally foregrounded by history, are points of connection. As the original idea of competitors living in a single spot on a river makes clear, much unites rivals. And they may even be deeply connected. Or, one could say in a figurative key, those who oppose one another are always actors in the same play.</p>",
            "<p>George Washington&rsquo;s favourite theatre-piece is said to have been Richard Brinsley Sheridan&rsquo;s comedy <span class='emphasize'>The Rivals</span> (1775). In this frothy play, various suitors vie for the hand of a lady and, after a cascade of laughable struggles and harebrained duels, are happily reconciled with one another. <span class='emphasize'>The Rivals</span> was also a favourite of Washington&rsquo;s antagonists and rivals and distant relations in Britain, including the royal family. Family ties joined Washington and his British rivals. And they were also joined by what often grows within the family, taste.</p><p>In 1796, near the end of Washington's life, his step-grand-daughter, Elizabeth Parke Custis, married into the British upper class by wedding Thomas Law, the brother of Britain's future vengeful and highly conservative Lord Chief Justice, Edward Law, Lord Ellenborough. At that point Washington&rsquo;s family became related to the British aristocracy not just by ancestry but also by marriage. It was as if family ties were binding him back into a world he had apparently seceded from. Indeed, these episodes might suggest that history, for all its tragedies, could equally well be written in a comic mode. Through the marriage in 1813 of Edward Law, the future Earl of Ellenborough, to Lady Octavia Stewart, George Washington&rsquo;s descendants even became related to the descendants of R. B. Sheridan, author of <span class='emphasize'>The Rivals</span>.</p>"
