        content: [
            "<p>In 1831, May Shelley explained that before she wrote Frankenstein she had wanted to produce books but had been unable to do so, being preoccupied with: \"Travelling, and the cares of a family, … and study, in the way of reading, or improving my ideas.\" Her apparent meaning is that the duties involved with looking after her infant children and her lover had stood in her way. But when she began Frankenstein the book she wrote transposed the phrase about \"the cares of a family\" into a different sense. Frankenstein is about a family’s sorrows. In Victor Frankenstein’s portion of the narrative, the most important word in his very first sentence is \"family\". And, throughout his narrative, many of the story’s turning points involve family members.</p><p>For example, the death of Frankenstein’s mother shortly before her son departs for university is the apparent stimulus to his compensatory desire to infuse \"life into an inanimate body.\" The monster, to whom Victor Frankenstein denies a mate that would allow him to propagate a whole race of monsters, later seems to take particular delight in revenging himself on Frankenstein family members: the brother William and the scientist’s bride Elizabeth. The death from grief of Frankenstein’s father is symbolically associated with these other deaths: at one remove, he is another of the monster’s victims. Frankenstein’s narrative logic relies for its shape and momentum on \"the cares of a family\".</p>            <p>Noticing the important of the familial themes in Mary Shelley’s novel makes reflection on Shelley’s own family impossible to avoid. The emotional and social complexities are astonishing. Mary’s father, the radical philosopher and novelist William Godwin, never married Mary’s mother, the author Mary Wollstonecraft. However Godwin later married Mary Jane Clairmont, who had already had two illegitimate children by different men. (At the time of the marriage, she called herself a widow but this was probably no more than a polite, socially acceptable fiction.) Godwin and Clairmont had a son of their own, William, a journalist, who died of cholera in 1832. Claire Clairmont, Mary Jane Clairmont’s daughter and Mary Shelley’s half-sister, had an affair with Byron, as we have already seen, and gave birth to their short-lived daughter Allegra. (The girl was briefly adopted by the Shelleys.) Claire Clairmont herself proved to be one of the longest-lasting members of the generally short-lived Byron-Shelley circle, dying in Florence in 1879 at the age of 80.</p><p>Mary Shelley’s mother, Mary Wollstonecraft, was also, like Mary Jane Clairmont, the mother of two illegitimate daughters: Mary Shelley (with Godwin) and Frances Imlay (with the author and speculator Gilbert Imlay). Wollstonecraft, whose most famous book was A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, fell prey to the not uncommon fate of mothers in the per-antibiotic era, dying just a few days after Mary Shelley was born. Mary Shelley eloped with the poet P. B. Shelley was she was just 16 years old and had and lost her first child, a daughter, Clara, when she was just 17. By the time Frankenstein was published in 1818 she was the mother of two more children, a son, William, and a second Clara. The latter died later that same year at the age of 1 and the former lasted only until he was three years old, dying of malaria in Rome in 1819. A few months after William’s death, Mary Shelley had her final child, Percy Florence Shelley. Percy was two when his father drowned in the Gulf of Spezia in July 1822.</p><p>So, by the time she was 24 Mary Shelley written Frankenstein, had given birth to four children and had lost three of them as well as losing her husband. Frankenstein is filled with lurid, violent deaths exacted or caused by an unreal monster. In comparison, the seeming fragility of multiple actual existences around Mary Shelley seems somehow more tragic, more mundane and more frightening. <a class='focusAction' onclick='plotNetwork(\"birthyear\",\"end\");colorByAttribute(\"tragedy\",[\"#CCFF99\",\"#5CAD5C\",\"#336600\"]);'>Mary Shelley’s family history began to dip towards the tragic</a> with the death of her mother, Mary Wollstonecraft in 1797 at the age of 28. Shelley’s first three children all died in infancy. And her husband perished at the age of 29. Thinking about Frankenstein in a metaphoric register makes one aware that the novel’s themes about creation and about the agony and destruction that this creation trails through the world in its wake resonate strongly with Shelley’s own actual circumstances. If one adds the suicide of her half-sister Fanny Imlay in Swansea in October 1816 at the age of 22 (just as Mary Shelley was starting to draft the final version of Frankenstein), then the impression of darkness and sadness in Shelley’s world is deepened, as is the impression that death strikes disproportionately early in the Romantic world around Shelley and Byron at women: mothers, sisters and daughters (and the adopted daughter Allegra Byron). Mary Shelley died in Victorian London, probably of a brain tumour, in 1851. She was 53.</p>",

            "<p>Kindred Britain is, at its core, a database of nearly 30,000 individuals, each connected to each other through some kind of genealogical tie. This allows the database to be represented as a network, similar to the social networks used in social network analysis. From that perspective, these individuals can be rated according to their network centrality, which implies a certain level of influence or importance within the network. This is reflected in the centrality ranking for each individual. This centrality measure is derived from a set of well-established, simple measures, each of which reveals a different aspect of the network.</p><p>Here we can see the top 20 most central individuals in Kindred Britain according to this Overall Centrality value. It's interesting to note that this group is <a class='focusAction' onclick='freeNodes();addHull();'>dominated by politicians</a>. None of them are born before the 17th century or after the 19th century. This fits well with the distribution of individuals in the network, which peaks during this period. These highly central individuals are not only closely related to the whole of Kindred Britain, but to each other, and on average are only 6 steps apart, with many connected by just a single common relative and the most distant only 12 steps away.  For comparison, the average path length of any individual to the rest of the network is over 17.</p><p>But centrality does not simply denote the densest part of the densest part of the network, as looking at the individual measures that make up Overall Centrality will reveal.</p>",
            "<p>The 20 least central actors in the Kindred Britain network have a distinctly different character. Only three have known professions, which would be expected for individuals on the fringe of the network. Of those three, two are rulers from the late 10th and early 11th century. While some measures of centrality favor the most dense parts of the network, others favor high traffic sparse areas, such as the spine of royalty that dominates the earliest centuries of British elites represented in Kindred Britain. As a result, the least central people have to be on the fringe of the network, which precludes the sparse but high-traffic early network and the dense but low-traffic late network.</p><p>This is why there are <a class='focusAction' onclick='plotNetwork(\"birthyear\",\"end\");colorByAttribute(\"birthyear\",[\"#3366CC\",\"#FFFF99\",\"#993333\"]);'>two identifiable troughs in the system</a> when looking at least central individuals. One is <a class='focusAction' onclick='moveTimeline(1000,50,120);'>from the late 9th to early 13th century</a> and typifies the kinds of edge cases that begin to appear as the network snakes out of the oldest records of rulers and their heirs. Before the 9th century, there were not enough detours into related and notable actors and their relations to see very low centrality numbers. The other cluster is <a class='focusAction' onclick='moveTimeline(1000,-1100,120);'>from the 17th to the 20th century</a>, and is typical of the grandparents and cousins that are included in Kindred Britain almost as an afterthought. A telltale sign in these cases is a dearth of events—these are individuals for whom we often only know of their marrying or giving birth to someone more connected to British culture and history. The scant geographic details we have about their place of birth or death, or that of their more central spouses, children, or parents, leaves little in the way of remarkable patterns: Anne Hewlett and Thomas Cushman both had a tie to Massachusetts, while Mary Maria Adams and Emily Cecilia Jones both had a significantly less surprising tie to London.</p><p>Notice that in most cases these individuals, along with being not closely related to the rest of Kindred Britain as a whole, are also not very closely related to each other. If you try to connect one to the other, the paths can be quite circuitous. They are, for the most part, not even in the same remote area of the network, which will not be the case with some of the centrality values we look at later. The average distance between these individuals is 35, with the longest distance a massive 60 steps and the shortest apart of 5 steps.</p><p>It is in royal ties that those few shortest routes between least central individuals deviate from the norm. The two 5 step paths occur from Herfast de Crepon to Ralph the Staller Earl of East Anglia and the 5 steps separating Rodrigo II from the Holy Roman Empress Matilda. Note that the people connecting these individuals are significantly more central.</p>",
            "<p>The first specific centrality measure we'll look at is network closeness. Closeness Centrality is a score based on the average distance to everyone else in a network from an individual, and as such points to a literal center of the network. In this case, that center is a group made up of 65% women and dominated by a single family. Of the 7 men in this group, <a class='focusAction' onclick='addHull();'>6 of them are in politics</a> in some way or another, with the only non-politician male being the 5th Duke of Devonshire, whose two daughters are married to politicians and whose sister-in-law was the first wife of his daughter Harriet's husband.

        overview: "Here's a story about Erasmus Darwin and some interesting things thereof.",
        image: 'erasmus.png',
    content: [
        "<p>The vision that Erasmus Darwin (1731-1802) articulated in his vast botanical poem in rhyming couplets The Loves of the Plants (1789) emphasizes prodigality, fertility, change, copiousness and, above all – as much through “unallowe’d desires” and “illicit loves” as through orthodox botanical “marriages” – the centrality of reproduction to life. Here is how Maureen McNeil describes Darwin’s thought in her entry on this “physician and natural philosopher” in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography:</p> <p>His pictorial representations and use of personification and pathetic fallacy intensified the Linnaean view of plant sexuality in which stamens are represented as men and pistils as women: lovers, brides, husbands, courtships, and pregnancies abound. The Loves of the Plants was Erasmus Darwin's first substantial exploration of what he considered to be key features of the natural world: the importance of reproduction and the continuities or analogies between the functioning of the vegetable and the animal worlds.</p><p>In thinking about such analogies, Darwin’s own world, both in terms of his familial and his professional associations, becomes an inescapable mirror for his intellectual cosmos of structured but also promiscuous interconnection. <a class='focusAction' onclick='recolorGraph(\"#D3D3D3\");highlightSubgraph([,\"I5904\",\"I7455\",\"I7464\",\"I7456\"], \"#993333\");highlightSubgraph([\"I5906\"], \"#FFFF99\");focusDiv(\"network\");'>Darwin’s own “marriages” and “illicit loves”</a> allow us to reflect on the intricate relations between the culture of family and the family of culture.</p>",
        "<p>Like his personal life, Darwin’s professional life was multidimensional. His poems describe a blended, heterogeneous cosmos in which “supernatural agents such as nymphs, gnomes, sylphs, and salamanders” mingle with “men of industry and science” (McNeil again).</p><p>Darwin’s medical work (first in Nottingham and Lichfield and then later in Derby) took in all sorts. While he focused it primarily on the wealthier echelons of the middle class, and in particular on the families of “men of industry and science”, also his work brought him into contact with the working class and with the very rich. Darwin hoped to establish a dispensary for Derby’s poor; yet on occasion he also treated people of “family, fortune and consequence”, such as the Countess of Northesk. He may even have been asked for help by the mad king George III – a request he seems to have turned down.</p>",
        "<h2>Marriages and children</h2><p>Darwin sprang from a solidly bourgeois background: his great-great grandfather, Erasmus Earle [I8767], was serjeant-at-law for Oliver Cromwell, his father (Robert Darwin [I7453]) was a wealthy Nottingham lawyer who retired early. Erasmus Darwin himself was twice married and eventually had at least 14 children (at least three of whom were illegitimate) from two marriages and from two non-marital liaisons. Five of his offspring died before their father. Darwin’s first union was relatively conventional, socially speaking. His wife was Mary Howard [I7455], who came from a similar background to her husband’s, being the daughter of a solicitor from Lichfield. Death was omnipresent in the family, even though at its head was a man whose profession was to preserve life. Mary Howard died in 1770 at the age of 30 and, though the couple had five children, only three of them survived to adulthood and only one, Robert Waring Darwin [I7460], a doctor and the father of Charles Darwin [I7462], outlived Erasmus Darwin.</p><p>(Father, son and grandson, Erasmus, Robert and Charles, as well as another grandson, Francis Galton [I7570], and three of Erasmus Darwin’s great-grandsons, George Darwin [I7501], Francis Darwin [I7503] and Horace Darwin [I7505], were all elected Fellows of the Royal Society.)</p>",
        "<p>Darwin’s second marriage was a contrast with respect both to social standing and to the robustness of the family members. Elizabeth Pole [I5904], Darwin's second wife, was the illegitimate daughter of Charles Colyear [I5874], 2nd Earl of Portmore, and thus the grand-daughter of Catharine Sedley [I5870], Countess of Dorchester and a mistress of James II [I3541]. Elizabeth had first encountered Darwin when she brought to him for treatment the children of her first marriage, to Col. Edward Sacheverel Pole [I5905], a professional soldier from the Derbyshire gentry who had lost an eye at the Battle of Minden in 1759. Elizabeth and Edward’s May-September marriage in 1769 (he was 51, she was 22) produced four offspring before the colonel died in 1780. So great were the social pretensions bred into some members of the Pole/Colyear family that Erasmus Darwin’s step-son, Sacheverel Pole [I7544], later petitioned to have his surname changed to Chandos-Pole in memory of a 14th century ancestor, Sir John Chandos, one of the founder members of the elite chivalric order of the Knights of the Garter, mortally wounded in the face by a stab-wound in France in 1369.</p>",
        "<p>Though the pair could not marry until after Elizabeth’s soldier husband died in 1780, the widowed but amorous Darwin had been smitten with Elizabeth Pole since 1775, when the man of science was so love-struck that he took up poetry again (“Speech of a Wood-Nymph”) after many years of lyric silence. They wed in 1781 and their marriage, which involved less of a disjunction in ages than her first union had (her new husband was 49 and she was 34) lasted over two decades until Darwin’s death in 1802. The couple produced seven children, six of whom survived childhood and then outlived their father. Darwin would probably never have met Elizabeth Pole, had he not established a reputation among the midlands gentry and aristocracy for medical competence. He first met her in a professional context, but their eventual marriage, subsequently allied with the success of his increasingly ambitious and widely publicized writings (all of which date from the years after his marriage to the aristocratically-connected Elizabeth), transformed his social standing. Indeed, through his second wife, Darwin was to establish distant familial links with some of the aristocrats, such as the Countess of Northesk, who visited him for treatment.</p>",
        "<p>Such is the “official” family history of Erasmus Darwin. But alongside, and intertwined with these legally-sanctioned relationships between husband and wife, father and mother and child, there were other strands of connections that could be described as the “dark networks” of relation within Darwin’s life, although Darwin does not appear to have denied or hidden his paternity of illegitimate children. As noted above, he fathered 14 children, three of whom were apparently born outside marriage to two separate mothers. Around the time of his first wife’s death, Darwin entered into a relationship with a married woman, Lucy Swift [I7464] and a daughter was born in mid-1771 with Darwin usually considered to have been her father. This daughter, also called Lucy Swift [I7465] shared Darwin’s fascination with botany and some of his intellectual affiliations: she was the author of An Introduction to the Elements of the Linnean System of Botany (1830) and ran a school in Derby.</p><p>Indeed, through this woman Darwin’s botanical obsessions exfoliated into connection with a whole branch of eminent botanists from a slightly later period. Lucy Swift’s daughter, Darwin’s probable granddaughter, Mary Hardcastle [I7468], married the eminent physician and botanist Francis Boott [I26591], scion of an Anglo-American family with strong connections to Derby. Boott spent time in Derby in the early years of the 19th century and may have deepened his interest in botany, which he had probably originally acquired from his father Kirk Boott [I26592], a Derby native who owned one of the earliest greenhouses in his adopted home city of Boston, under the tutelage of Lucy Hardcastle, Darwin’s illegitimate daughter. Francis Boott was the Vice-President of the Linnean Society in London between 1861 and 1863 and was the author of an authoritative four-volume work on sedges. His brothers, Wright Boott [I26604], James Boott [I26608] and William Boott were all keen horticulturalists and members of the Boston Society of Natural History. In particular Wright Boott, an eccentric and reclusive character who ended up shooting himself in 1845, was an eminent New World grower of orchids.</p>",
        "<p>(Wright Boott, whose full name was John Wright Boott, was apparently named after his father Kirk’s friend John Wright [I26617], the nephew of the artist Joseph Wright [I25848], usually known as Joseph Wright of Derby, who painted Erasmus Darwin at least twice and whom Darwin treated for asthma and dropsy. The Wright and Boott families in Derby seem to have been closely connected. Wright painted Mary Turnaley [I26613], the wife of Kirk Boott’s great-nephew, another Francis Boott [I26612]. He also painted the Derby-born Ann Haden [I26595], who married the American industrialist Kirk Boott II [I26594], a brother of the botanist Francis Boott [I26591] (see above). Wright had also painted and sketched Ann’s father, Thomas Haden [I26596], when he was a young man. Thomas Haden became an eminent doctor in Derby and when Darwin retired around 1801 it was Thomas Haden, twice a mayor of the city and an alderman, who took over Darwin’s medical practice.)</p>",
        "<p>At about the time that Darwin’s relationship with Lucy Swift ended, he became enamoured of Mary Parker [I7456], whom he had engaged as a governess for his son Robert Waring Darwin (Charles Darwin’s father). This affair produced a further two illegitimate daughters, Susanna Parker [I7457] and Mary Parker [I7458], who, in time and like their natural sister Lucy Swift, would also be involved in running a school. Darwin tried to help his illegitimate daughters in their endeavours, for example publishing at their instigation in 1797 a volume of supervisory advice for young woman engaged in the business of schooling: A Plan for the Conduct of Female Education, in Boarding Schools. All Darwin’s illegitimate daughters worked for a living outside the home in a way that his legitimate daughters never did and the only one of his daughters who was an author was the illegitimate Lucy Swift. Sometime around 1775 the “association” (to use the genealogical jargon) between Darwin and Mary Parker came to an end, at about the point Darwin fell in love with the still-married Elizabeth Pole. So far as the historical record is concerned, all Darwin’s subsequent children were born legitimately.</p><p>Darwin’s natural children, fathered with Lucy Swift and Mary Parker, introduce new dimensions and gradations of class and gender position into the understanding of “family” in Erasmus Darwin’s personal history. For instance, as we have seen, Lucy Swift’s life story was intimately formed by her father’s love of botany and it was through her that Darwin’s history connects with the Anglo-American botanical dynasty of the Boott family. Darwin’s familial connections spread out, not to much like the dully unnatural sticks and branches trained at perfect right-angles in a traditionally-drawn, and impeccably conventional family “tree”, but more like a series of naturally arabesquing and exploratorily roving tendrils of one of the polyphiloprogenitive plants and their “loves” that he wrote about enthusiastically.</p>",
        "<h2>Intellectual associates and family</h2><p>Moving, as “Kindred Britain” does, beyond the limited ambitions (and capacities) of the orthodox genealogical diagram, it becomes possible to see a dense world of familial linkages, hitherto largely invisible or at best ignored, that colour and perhaps structure Erasmus Darwin’s intellectual affiliations. For example, Darwin’s best-known relationship with other industrialists and experimenters in the 18th century Midlands is mediated through the Lunar Society of Birmingham, established in the city around 1765 and most intensely active in the period between 1781 and 1791 when, after the Lunar Society had welcomed the French Revolution, a Birmingham mob sacked the house and laboratory of Lunar Society member Joseph Priestley [I26113] and destroyed Priestley’s Unitarian New Meeting House. (The house where the typographer John Baskerville had lived was also destroyed in the 1791 riot.)</p><p>It has been usual to think of the Lunar Society’s members in terms of their shared mercantile, reforming and industrial interests and their commitment to experimentation whether in education or steam engines. But these intellectual ties were suggestively subtended or consolidated by a set of personal, familial associations. Sometimes it seems that the family connections were created by membership of the Lunar Society. For example, the ceramicist and businessman Josiah Wedgwood [I7493] met Darwin in the early 1760s when Wedgwood was lobbying for the construction of the Trent-Mersey canal. Wedgwood became strongly involved with Lunar Society activities and the society’s members influenced his experiments and business activities. Thus, Wedgwood took the Soho works of Lunar Society member and entrepreneur Matthew Boulton [I26116] as the model for his manufacturing plant the Etruria Works in Stoke-on-Trent on the path of the Trent-Mersey canal. Darwin suggest the name to Wedgwood (the place had previously been known as the Ridgehouse Estate) and presumably also the motto for the complex, “Artes Etruriae renascuntur”, in allusion to the excavations of Etruscan pottery then being conducted in Tuscany.</p>",
        "<p>These working associations were sealed by the marriage of Darwin’s son Robert Waring Darwin to Wedgwood’s eldest daughter Susannah Wedgwood [I7461]. These were the future parents of Charles Darwin. Darwin was later to marry his cousin and Josiah Wedgwood’s granddaughter, Emma Wedgwood [I7463]. Commentators such as Maureen McNeil have linked the evolutionary theories of Charles Darwin to speculations he found in his grand-father’s works: “Early exposure to the ideas of [Erasmus Darwin’s] Zoonomia was crucial in Charles's formulation of his theory of evolution.” But, equally, it was the pottery wealth that flowed into the Darwin family through intermarriages with the Wedgwoods that provided the material basis for Charles Darwin’s long, meditative retreats during which he worked on his transformative books. Without the Lunar Society, it seems unlikely that the Darwin would have been wealthy enough to pursue his theories independently and at length.</p>",
        "<p>Other intellectual or business relationships that Darwin had with industrialists and reformers in 18th century Britain that were later consolidated through marriage. Thus “Kindred Britain” can show the links between Darwin and the Derbyshire politician Samuel Crompton [I26299], the industrialist Sir Richard Arkwright [I23668], and Lunar Society member and educationalist Thomas Day [I26135]. Indeed of the 13 core members of the Lunar Society, the “Kindred Britain” demonstrates family links between 10: Darwin, Wedgwood, Boulton, Day, Priestley, the engineer and educationalist Richard Lovell Edgeworth [I7600], the Quaker arms manufacturer Samuel Galton [I7541], the chemist James Keir [I12695], the engineer and scientist James Watt [I26218] and the physician William Withering [I26183]. (The only central members of the Lunar Society not present in “Kindred Britain” database are William Small, Jonathan Stokes and John Whitehurst.)</p>",
        "<p>“Kindred Britain” not only visualizes the familial links that connect intellectual and business partners. It can also, more subversively, expose chains of kin and relation between antagonists as well. For example, Withering and Darwin engaged in the most serious personal dispute that arose between members of the Lunar Society. Darwin had sporadically experimented on patients with heart conditions by treating them with the drug digitalis, which is extracted from foxgloves. He also hurried into print in 1785 an article written by his son Robert Waring Darwin on the use of the medicine. Only a short while later Withering published his long-considered and far more systematic An Account of the Foxglove and some of its Medical Uses, &c. Withering took offense at what he considered the effort to pre-empt his claim to be the first physician to use digitalis in his medical practice. This initial dispute deepened over succeeding years until Withering and Darwin were deeply alienated, while still being linked. Other enemies of Darwin’s with whom he shared a prospective family connection include the conservative political parodists George Canning [I15876] (later briefly Prime Minister) and J. H. Frere [I24279] who together in The Anti-Jacobin, a pro-government periodical, lampooned Darwin’s poetry and ideas towards the end of the doctor’s life. Yet Canning and Frere were to become connected to Darwin through the marriage in 1822 of the banker Daniel Gurney [I9026] to Lady Jemima Hay [I9027].</p>",
        "<h3>Conclusion</h3><p>These occult connections developed between former foes suggest several important truths about English cultural life. The first is that family history is not just a matter of tracing direct, lineal modes of descent, linking, for example, the 18th century doctor and poet Erasmus Darwin to the scientist Charles Darwin or even to the 2nd Lieutenant Erasmus Darwin [I7705] (a great-great grandson of the 18th century doctor) who died at Ypres in 1915. It also involves tracing the “dark networks” of unofficial or illegitimate relation that have played such a small part in the inheritance of property and such a large part in the passing on of artistic and intellectual passions. The second truth that consideration of Darwin’s family connections suggests is that lateral, intellectual affiliations of the kinds traced here between the eminent middle ranks of society and Lunar Society members are sometimes underwritten by family ties, if not explicitly known of then sensed or intuited. The third is that (as in the case of the intermarriages of the Darwin and Wedgwood families) intellectual affiliations sometimes create significant family ties, leading to further important cultural production. A fourth is that intellectual or political opposition are often dissolved or reconciled by eventual family linkages, just as emergent men of wealth who arose out of the profiteering of the Industrial Revolution and were a latent threat to the old aristocratic order, were often absorbed by marriage into the older structures of power which they might have seemed to put in jeopardy.</p><p>Lastly, a fifth truth to be gleaned from the consideration of Erasmus Darwin’s complicated networks of kin and intellect is that to an extraordinary degree, English life seems to have consisted, generation after generation, in keeping the businesses of culture and intellect, like the old silver and the ancestral portraits, firmly “in the family”.</p><p>- Nicholas Jenkins</p>"
